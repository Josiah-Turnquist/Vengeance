# Vengeance

I am Josiah Turnquist, 19 years old, hardworking student at Diablo Valley College. Currently in my sixth semester and working toward finishing my undergraduate classes for my COMSC major. Hopeful UC Berkeley transfer.

Ennui is my Intro to Programming final project, hopefully to be drastically improved by all new material learned in my Advanced Programming class. Super hyped to keep working on this.
